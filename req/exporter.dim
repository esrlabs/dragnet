                   Since none of the properties of an MTR are guaranteed to be
                   unique among them, the exporters shall generate a unique ID
                   for each MTR to allow them to be uniquely identified outside
                   of Dragnet.

                   The unique ID shall be generated by SHA1-hashing a string
                   with the concatenation of:

                   * The name of the file that contains the MTR
                   * The content of the 'id' field (converted to string)

                   Only the first 16 characters of the resulting SHA1 shall be
                   used.
